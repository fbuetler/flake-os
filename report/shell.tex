\section{Shell}

The shell is split into two modules, a serial server and the shell itself.

\subsection{Serial Server}
The serial server can be seen as a rudimentary TTY. It reads and writes through UART and buffers incoming characters.
With only little modification multiple TTYs could be launched, each using a different UART port.
