\section{Multi-core Support}

TODO

% each core gets 512mb (core 0 initially has all memory and allocs for other cores)
% assumed core 0 is always present (only core 1-3 on/off)
% primary-secondary communication
% pid ranges per core
% communication between cores ofer urpc frame used as a ring buffer (split into 2 halfs)
% first 64 bytes of a half are reserved for metadata (historical reasons)
% every ump messages iz 64 bytes (a cache line) inclusive header
% can send messages that are larger than one cache line
% memory barriers at the right locaions to work with ARMs weak memory model
% communication protocal is based on a volatile variable
% core 1 know where the shared frame is because its passed at a well known location

% extra:
% boot all cores 
% turn core off and on
